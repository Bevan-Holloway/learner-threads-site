You're developing your identity as a learner who can think like an expert in any field.</p>

                                        🌟 <strong>The magic happens when:</strong> You choose a learning disposition (like curiosity) in a subject (like science) and discover specific ways to express it through your head, heart, and hands. This is how you develop your identity as someone who can think like a scientist, artist, historian, or mathematician.
